                <strong>5. Bananas: The Potassium-Rich Snack</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Why They're Super:</strong> Bananas are an energy-boosting fruit rich in potassium, fiber, and Vitamin B6. They’re naturally sweet, require no prep, and are perfect for on-the-go snacking.</li>
