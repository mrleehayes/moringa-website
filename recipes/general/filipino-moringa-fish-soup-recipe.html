      <section class="cultural-significance">
        <h2>Cultural Significance of Sinabawang Isda</h2>
        <p>In Filipino culture, fish soups like sinabawang isda are more than just nutritious meals—they represent family tradition and resourcefulness. This dish is commonly prepared in coastal communities where fresh fish is abundant.</p>
        
        <p>The addition of moringa leaves (malunggay) is particularly significant, as this plant grows abundantly throughout the Philippines and has been used for generations as both food and medicine. During the rainy season, when colds and flu are common, Filipino families often prepare this soup as a natural remedy.</p>
        
        <p>The simple cooking method reflects the Filipino value of "lutong bahay" (home cooking), where fresh ingredients and minimal processing create dishes that nourish both body and soul.</p>

      <section class="personal-experience">
        <h2>My Journey with Filipino Moringa Fish Soup</h2>
        <p>I first discovered this recipe during my travels through Cebu, where a local lola introduced me to her family's version of sinabawang isda. The simple combination of fresh fish and moringa leaves created a flavor that was both delicate and satisfying.</p>
        
        <p>Back home, I found myself craving this nourishing soup whenever I felt under the weather. The gentle heat from the chilies combined with the mineral-rich broth became my go-to immune booster during cold seasons. I've since shared this recipe with countless friends who report the same sense of comfort and well-being after enjoying a bowl.</p>
        
        <p>While traditional recipes vary from family to family, this version represents the authentic techniques I learned firsthand, with minor adaptations to make it accessible for home cooks outside the Philippines.</p>

      <section class="recipe-variations">
        <h2>Recipe Tips and Variations</h2>
        
        <h3>Chef's Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>For the most authentic flavor, use whole fish with head and bones intact, as they enrich the broth.</li>
          <li>Add moringa leaves only in the final minutes of cooking to preserve their nutrients and bright color.</li>
          <li>If using dried moringa powder instead of fresh leaves, add 1-2 tablespoons at the very end of cooking.</li>
          <li>For a clearer broth, avoid stirring too much after adding the fish.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Regional Variations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Visayan-Style:</strong> Adds ginger and bitter gourd for extra medicinal properties.</li>
          <li><strong>Mindanao-Style:</strong> Incorporates coconut milk for a richer, creamier broth.</li>
          <li><strong>Modern Adaptation:</strong> Uses fish fillet instead of whole fish for convenience and adds spinach if moringa is unavailable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What type of fish works best in Filipino moringa soup?</h3>
          <p>Traditional Filipino recipes typically use whole white fish like milkfish (bangus), tilapia, or pompano. These mild-flavored fish complement the earthy taste of moringa leaves without overpowering them. For convenience, you can use any firm white fish fillets available in your area.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I use moringa powder instead of fresh leaves?</h3>
          <p>Yes, if fresh moringa leaves aren't available, you can substitute with 1-2 tablespoons of moringa powder. Add the powder during the last minute of cooking to preserve its nutritional properties. The flavor will be slightly different but still beneficial.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Is Filipino moringa fish soup spicy?</h3>
          <p>Traditional sinabawang isda has a mild to moderate level of spiciness from green chilies. You can adjust the heat level by removing the seeds from the chilies (for milder flavor) or omitting them entirely. Some regions add more chilies for a spicier version.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How do I store leftover moringa fish soup?</h3>
          <p>Leftover soup can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 days. When reheating, bring it to a gentle simmer rather than boiling to preserve the texture of the fish. The flavor often improves on the second day as the ingredients meld together.</p>
