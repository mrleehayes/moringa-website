            <h2 id="water-filter">DIY Moringa Water Filter: Purify Water Affordably</h2>
            <p>
                Access to clean water is a fundamental need. In areas where clean water is scarce, moringa seeds offer a natural and cost-effective solution. Using <b>moringa seeds as a water purifier</b> is one of the best applications of the plant. Here's how:
            </p>

            <h3>How to Use Moringa Seeds for Water Purification:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Collect & Dry Seeds:</b> Gather mature, dry moringa pods and remove the seeds.
                <!-- VISUAL HINT: Add an image here of dry moringa pods and seeds. -->
                <!-- <img src="/blog/images/moringa-dry-pods-and-seeds.webp" alt="Dry moringa pods with seeds next to them." style="width:100%; max-width:400px; margin: 1em 0;"> -->
                </li>
                <li><b>Shell the Seeds:</b> Remove the outer shells to get the white kernels.</li>
                <li><b>Crush the Kernels:</b> Grind the kernels into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle or a clean stone.
                <!-- VISUAL HINT: Add an image of moringa kernels being ground into a powder. -->
                <!-- <img src="/blog/images/grinding-moringa-seeds.webp" alt="Moringa kernels being ground into a fine white powder." style="width:100%; max-width:400px; margin: 1em 0;"> -->
                </li>
                <li><b>Mix with Water:</b> For moderately turbid water, use approximately 1 tablespoon (2 grams) of powder per liter of water. Mix the powder with a small amount of clean water to create a paste.</li>
                <li><b>Stir Vigorously:</b> Add the paste to the water you want to purify and stir quickly for 5-10 minutes. This helps the moringa's natural clarifying agents bind to impurities.</li>
                <li><b>Settle and Clarify:</b> Allow the water to stand undisturbed for at least 1-2 hours. You will see the impurities sink to the bottom.</li>
                <li><b>Decant the Clean Water:</b> Carefully pour the clean water from the top, leaving the sediment behind.
                <!-- VISUAL HINT: Add a comparison image of murky water vs. clear, decanted water. -->
                <!-- <img src="/blog/images/moringa-water-before-after.webp" alt="A glass of murky water next to a glass of clear water after moringa purification." style="width:100%; max-width:400px; margin: 1em 0;"> -->
                </li>
                <li><b>Boil Before Drinking (CRITICAL STEP):</b> While moringa clarifies water, it doesn't sterilize it. **You must boil the treated water for at least one minute** to kill any remaining bacteria and viruses, ensuring it is safe to drink.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Moringa seeds contain natural polymers that act as coagulants, causing particles to clump and settle. This simple method can significantly reduce turbidity and bacterial contamination. <b>This is a great option for a DIY homemade water filter for rural communities.</b> You can find more details in our <a href="/resources/">resources</a> section.

            <h2 id="moringa-oil">Bonus: How to Make Moringa Oil at Home</h2>
            <p>
                Moringa oil is a valuable product with many uses. Making it at home can be a profitable venture if you have access to a press.
            </p>
            <h3>How to Make Moringa Oil at Home (Cold-Press Method):</h3>

                <li><b>Cold Pressing:</b> This is the best and safest method. Use a manual cold-press oil extractor. Feed the ground moringa meal into the press and collect the oil as it is extracted. This preserves the oil's nutrients without heat or chemicals.</li>

                <li><b>Store Properly:</b> Store your pure moringa oil in a dark glass bottle in a cool, dark place to preserve its quality.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Selling homemade, cold-pressed moringa oil can be a good source of income. Market your oil at local farmers' markets or to neighbors.
