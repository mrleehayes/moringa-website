                <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Moringa Powder</h2>

                <h3>1. Harvest Fresh Moringa Leaves</h3>
                <p>Pick healthy, vibrant green moringa leaves early in the morning.  Avoid any yellow or damaged leaves.  Younger leaves are generally more tender and flavorful.</p>

                <h3>2. Wash the Leaves</h3>
                <p>Rinse the leaves thoroughly under clean, running water to remove any dirt, dust, or impurities.  Gently shake off excess water.</p>
                <!-- <img src="/images/washing-moringa-leaves.jpg" alt="Washing fresh moringa leaves" width="400" height="300" loading="lazy"> --> <!-- Add your actual image here -->

                <h3>3. Dry the Leaves</h3>
                <p>This is a crucial step! Spread the leaves in a single layer in a well-ventilated, shaded area. Direct sunlight can damage the nutrients. The ideal temperature is between 70-85°F (21-29°C) with low humidity. Let them air dry for 3-5 days, or until they are completely crisp and crumble easily. Ensure leaves don't mold, if the air is too humid, consider using a dehydrator at a low setting.</p>

                <h3>4. Grind Into Powder</h3>
                <p>Use a high-speed blender or food processor to grind the dried leaves into a fine powder. A Vitamix or similar blender works best. If you don't have a blender, you can use a mortar and pestle, though it will take more effort. For a smoother texture, sift the powder through a fine-mesh sieve. </p>

                <h3>5. Store Properly</h3>
                <p>Transfer the powder into an airtight glass jar or container. Make sure the jar is completely dry to prevent clumping. Store it in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight and heat to maintain freshness and potency for up to 6 months.</p>
