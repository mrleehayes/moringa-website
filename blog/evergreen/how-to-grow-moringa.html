            <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Growing Moringa</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose Your Method of Propagation: You can grow moringa from seeds or cuttings.</li>
                <li>Prepare the Soil: Whether you're planting seeds or cuttings, prepare the soil by loosening it and adding compost.</li>
                <li>Planting Seeds: Soak the moringa seeds in water for 24 hours before planting. Plant the seeds about 1 inch deep in well-drained soil. Water gently and keep the soil moist but not waterlogged.</li>
                <li>Planting Cuttings: Dip the cut end of the cutting in rooting hormone. Plant the cutting about 6 inches deep in well-drained soil. Water gently and keep the soil moist but not waterlogged. Maintain soil moisture to allow your cutting to root.</li>
                <li>Watering: Water your moringa tree regularly, especially during dry periods. Allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.</li>
                <li>Fertilizing: Fertilize your moringa tree every few months with a balanced fertilizer.

You can control these pests with organic pesticides or by handpicking them off the tree. Moringa is also relatively disease-resistant, but it can be susceptible to fungal diseases in humid climates. Ensure your tree has good air circulation and avoid overwatering to prevent fungal diseases.
